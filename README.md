# Fys 5429
### By Sigurd Vargdal.

This repository contains two projects for the course Fys 5429 (Advanced machine learning and data analysis for the physical sciences) the spring of 2025 at UIO. The projects was used for two main purposes. The first was practising writing scientific rapports by doing numerical projects. The second one was to become familiar with the machine learning (ML) architectures that would be used in the author's masters project. 

The projects was based on doing two separate architectures on the same data. The dataset was made up of around $10 000$ 2d topologies from porous media made with 2d binary grids. Using a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) to solve the Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity field, the permeability could be calculated after the simulation. The ML task was then the find a map from the topology to the permeability. Project 1 used the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture and project 2 used the Vision Transformer (ViT).
